# NASM tutor

This repo is just me following the [NASM tutor](https://asmtutor.com) steps.  

The programs are ran and tested in x86_64 linux.

Opcodes and syscalls [table link](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/HEAD/constants/syscalls.md#x86_64-64_bit)  

In order to run an example do:
```bash
./run.sh ./lesssons/hello-world
```
